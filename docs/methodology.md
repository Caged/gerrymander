Find block groups within congressional districts that lie outside of the 90% confidence band for a variety of American Community Survey data.

The final numbers need to be a percentage of the blockgroup population.  For instance, % of BG that is black.

black population / total population = % black population

Example of how this can be visualized

● = Percentile
★ = Outlier block group

```
name     5th                mean                         95th
